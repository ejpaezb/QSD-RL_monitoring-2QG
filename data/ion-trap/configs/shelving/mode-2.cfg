        F               0.5 ; As for F, F = 0.5 is usually a good initial choice. If the population converges prematurely, then F and/or nPopulation should be increased. Values of F smaller than 0.4, like those greater than 1, are only occasionally effective.
        CR              0.9 ; A good first choice for CR is 0.1, but since a large CR often speeds convergence, to first try CR = 0.9 or CR = 1.0 is appropriate in order to see if a quick solution is possible.
